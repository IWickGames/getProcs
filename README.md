# getProcs
A python library to get the currently running programs

Use by placing the .py file in your project dir and doing a import getProcs

Use:
  getProcs.getProcs() | Get a raw list of running exe files
  getProcs.monitorProcs(runTimes) | This will check the amount of times said and output a list of created processes in that time

# OutDated
This repository has become outdated as I have developed a better version with my project FileDefender. That will be released here soon
